Rock vs Mine detection.
Created a small machine learning project. 
Build a detection system with Logistic regression. 
It will help submarines to detect that if the signals they are receiving are from a mine or a rock which will enhance the safety of the submarines.
Took a small dataset 'Sonar.csv' to test and they gave a good 80% accuracy with the training dataset and 76% accuracy with the testing dataset.
Build the entire project on Jupyter notebook itself.
